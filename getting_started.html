    <h1>The Basics</h1>
    <p>
    Lets start some basics knowledge about the cards in Magic: The Gathering. Firstly magic cards are represented by 5 colours:
    <span>White</span>, <span>Blue</span>, <span>Black</span>, <span>Red</span>, and <span>Green</span>. Each of these colours
    tend to follow a theme or style of gameplay.
    </p>

    <p>
        The colours of your cards will also indicate the <i>conditions</i> needed to cast them.<br/>
        Let's breakdown the parts of the card below:

    <h2>What are the phases of a turn?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Untap</li>
        <li>Upkeep</li>
        <li>Draw</li>
        <li>Main Phase 1</li>
        <li>Combat Phase</li>
        <li>Main Phase 2</li>
        <li>End Step</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>What happens during each phase?</h2>
    <p>
        At the beginning of the turn there are three phases before you start playing most lands and spells.<br/>
        The Untap phase where you untap all the cards you control in play (A.K.A permanents).<br/>
        The Upkeep phase where things will sometimes happen.<br/>
        The Draw phase where you will take the top card of you deck and put it into your hand (this is called drawing a card).<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here they are summarized in the table below:
    </p>
    <table style="width: 100%;" border="1px solid black;">
        <tr>
            <th>What happens here?</th>
            <th>Untap</th>
            <th>Upkeep</th>
            <th>Draw</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Can I cast spells?</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Only Instants and Cards with Flash</td>
            <td>Only Instants and Cards with Flash</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Can I activate abilities</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Yes (unless they are Sorcery speed only)</td>
            <td>Yes (unless they are Sorcery speed only)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What do I do?</td>
            <td>Untap all Permanents you control</td>
            <td>Nothing unless a card specifies</td>
            <td>Draw a card</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

        <p>Note: Don't worry about the Upkeep for now, we'll get to that later.</p>
