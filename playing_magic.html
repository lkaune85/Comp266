    <div class="row">
        <p>
        There are many ways to play Magic: The Gathering from online to in person. This page seeks to help you decide how you want to play and where you can get started!<br/><br/>
        <em>Online</em><br/>
        
            To play Magic over the internet there is currently two-ways:
            <ol>
                <li>Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO)</li>
                <li>Magic: The Gathering Arena (MTGA)</li>
            </ol>
            They are both very different systems.<br/> 
            MTGO is a paid version of Magic where you can buy and sell virtual cards with other players. MTGO is considered very similar to Paper Magic in that regard.<br/>
            The game is not free and there is currently now way to play it without spending money as well.<br/>
            MTGA on the other is a free version of Magic where you craft cards from wild cards. You can earn wild cards by playing the game or by purchasing online product.<br/>
            Anyone can play MTGA without spending any money and is often considered for great for newer players. However, the progression of building a collection is very slow
            and if you do decide to spend money on the game then it can easily become more expensive than MTGO.<br/>

        <em>In Person (aka Paper)</em><br/>
        <p>
            In person Magic is often considered the most popular way to play Magic: The Gathering. 
            You buy physical cards either in store or online and play with people in person.
            You will likely need to buy additional product in order to help protect you cards such as sleeves or deck boxes.
